## Back story: 
- I was cleaning my closet and I found older Raspberry Pi 3B+. Which I bought in 2018. Good part is, it's still working!
- Since I found a mini, low powserful computer, I thought let's do something meaningful with it. So I decided to create a local cloud using Django Python3, where data will get store locally on Raspberry Pi (on SD card) but can be accessible from anywhere on earth using HttpSocket.

## Purpose:
- I want to build a homeserver which does regular, day-to-day task for me, like: online storage, notify when someone comes at my door steps or run daily basic job to check CAD to INR exchange rate!!

## Steps:
- Create a localserver by installing Apache server
- Setup Django and dependencies locally
- Start coding 👨‍💻👨‍💻👨‍💻
    - Build createUser endpoint where user can able to create an account
    - Attach a directory with a user after user create their account
    - Build login flow
    - Implement a logic to upload stuffs to the homeserver using HttpSocket
    - Testing, Testing, Testing...
    - Deployment, Port Forwarding, Static IP (I don't know how to do any of these!)

## Timeline:
- I'm planning to push new feature every week, Let's see how it goes!
